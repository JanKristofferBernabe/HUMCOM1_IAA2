    <h3>The First Name of the Piano</h3>
    <article>
        <p>The instrument was actually first named "clavicembalo col piano e forte" in which 
            it was somewhat/literally a harpsichord that can play soft and loud noises. In the
            modern era, it was now shortened to the new common name which is the name, "piano."

    <h3>History and Origin of the Piano</h3>
    <article>
        <p>The piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731) of Italy.
            Cristofori was unsatisfied by the lack of control that musicians had over the
            volume level of the harpsichord. He is credited for switching out the plucking 
            mechanism with a hammer to create the modern piano in around the year 1700.

    <h3>What is Piano?</h3>
    <article>
        <p>The piano is an acoustic, keyboard, stringed percussion instrument in which the strings 
            are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material (modern hammers are 
            covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played using a 
            keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) that the performer presses down or 
            strikes with the fingers and thumbs of both hands to cause the hammers to strike the 
            strings. It was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700.
