                                <div class="top-left">One of the thing that I can't barely live without is the Piano, music is my passion, music is my ministry, and I found my fortress in it. Piano is the why I am still alive in the world of lots of contradictory. Looking into the best things that the piano has influenced me is that i learned committment, humbleness, learning and progressing. Piano/keyboard is the very common root reason why I am brought closer to God because I am part of a worship ministry in which our only goal none any other thing which is to praise and glorify God. If I were given a chance to learn other instruments is that I will take the opportunity to grow more.</div>

                    <div class="top-left">Entertainment, teamwork, organization and cooperation. Basketball has become one of the popular sports nowadays wherein it was widely known. It is one of my favorite sports because since that I am an NBA fan I always tend to copy the moves of some veteran point guards namely as Stephen Curry, known as one of the great shooters in the league today. Basketball has become of the integral part of myself because I was taught on how to be a good teammate.</div>

                        <div class="top-left">One of the best things that I have discover as a Christian is by worshipping God, it is where I felt the presence of the holy spirit showering upon. I always want the feeling wherein I suddenly surrender to God everything, I cried, I praised Him, I glorify Him. Also, for me worshipping is also like communicating with God thru singing with all my heart as by worshipping Him is that He is giving us the courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the diffrence.</div>
